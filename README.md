## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Elixir 1.14+ and Erlang/OTP 25+
- PostgreSQL 14+
  - Hints:
    Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running before proceeding.
    In development, the project uses the "postgres" user, perhaps create the user "postgres", so you don't have to change the config/dev.exs database configuration:
    ```bash
    psql -d postgres -c "CREATE USER postgres WITH SUPERUSER CREATEDB CREATEROLE;"
    ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rroupski/retirement_planner.git
   cd retirement_planner
   ```

2. Install dependencies and set up the database:
   ```bash
   mix setup
   ```
   This command will:
   - Install Elixir dependencies with `mix deps.get`
   - Create and migrate the database
   - Install and build assets

3. Start the Phoenix server:
   ```bash
   mix phx.server
   ```

4. Visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) in your browser

### Alternative Setup Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies only
mix deps.get

# Database operations
mix ecto.create              # Create database
mix ecto.migrate             # Run migrations
mix ecto.reset               # Drop and recreate database with seeds

# Start server with IEx console
iex -S mix phx.server

# Asset management
mix assets.setup             # Install Tailwind and esbuild
mix assets.build             # Build assets for development
mix assets.deploy            # Build and minify for production
```

## üß™ Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
mix test

# Run tests in watch mode
mix test --stale
